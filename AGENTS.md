# AI Agents Instructions

## Overview
This document serves as the entry point for AI-assisted development of the UKNF Communication System with Entities. It references detailed instructions for different aspects of the system.

---

## üìã Documentation Structure

### 1. [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
**System Architecture Instructions**

Defines the overall system architecture including:
- Four-layer architecture (Frontend, Backend, Database, Message Queue)
- Communication patterns between layers
- Architecture diagram
- AI development guidelines for system design
- Deployment architecture with Docker

**When to use**: 
- Understanding the big picture of the system
- Planning how components interact
- Making architectural decisions
- Setting up the overall system structure

---

### 2. [BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
**Backend Development Instructions**

Provides detailed specifications for Java/Spring Boot backend:
- OpenJDK 21 platform
- Spring Boot 3.5+ framework
- Hibernate 6.x ORM
- CQRS architecture pattern
- Security implementation (OAuth 2.0, JWT)
- Database and message queue integration
- Containerization requirements

**When to use**:
- Implementing backend API endpoints
- Setting up Spring Boot application
- Configuring database connections
- Implementing authentication/authorization
- Creating Docker containers for backend

---

## ü§ñ AI Agent Workflow

### For New Feature Development

1. **Start with [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**
   - Understand which layer(s) the feature affects
   - Review communication patterns
   - Plan data flow

2. **Backend Implementation: [BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md)**
   - Follow Java/Spring Boot specifications
   - Implement CQRS pattern
   - Add proper validation
   - Secure with JWT

3. **Frontend Implementation: [README.md](./README.md)**
   - React component structure
   - API integration
   - UI/UX based on templates

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for:
- Project generation history
- Prompt log with numbered iterations
- Files modified in each iteration
- Quick reference for regeneration

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For AI Agents:
1. Read this file first
2. Review [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for system overview
3. Refer to [BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md](./BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for backend tasks
4. Check [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for project history

### For Developers:
1. Review all documentation files
2. Set up local development environment (see README.md)
3. Follow architecture guidelines strictly
4. Implement features according to layer responsibilities

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Always consult ARCHITECTURE.md before making structural changes
- Follow BACKEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md specifications strictly for backend code
- Maintain separation of concerns between layers
- Use CQRS pattern for all backend operations
- Implement security at every layer
- Container all services using Docker
